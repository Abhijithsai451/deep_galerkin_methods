Physics Informed Neural Networks - Implementation Plan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install the dependencies.
2. Neural Network Architecture:
    The Core of the PINN is the neural network, which acts as the solution u'(x,t,ø)
    Define the Input: the network must accept the independent variables x and t (input size 2)
    Design the Model Class: We create a python class (PINN_Model) which inherits from torch.nn.Module.
        Architecture: We start with a simple MLP
            Layers: 4 - 6 Fully connected layers
            Neurons: 20 to 50 Neurons per layer.
            Activation: Typically tanh or SiLU (swish) for PINNs, as they perform better than ReLU for derivatives.
            Output Size: 1 (predicted temperature u)
3. Physics Loss Function:
    The Most crucial and unique part of PINNs. It enforces the PDE on the solution.
    Implement the Derivative Function : We create a helper function (or a method within your model class) to calculate the
    derivatives of the network output u with respect to the inputs x and t.
    We use pytorch function for Autograd
    Define the PDE Residual:
    Calculate the Physics Loss
